Manual testing (npm start) is required to check the login form and the sortable, lazy-loading list.\

Testable Features:

- Login/Logout-Form with input validation
- Sortable (Drag & Drop), Lazy-Loading list (logout to reset the list)

### `npm test`

Automatic tests (npm test) are mostly smoke tests, to check if the app is running and if the components are rendered.
