# The Key Technology - React/GraphQL Sortable List with Login Form App

Automatic tests (npm test) are mostly smoke tests, to check if the app is running and if the components are rendered.
Manual testing (npm start) is required to check the login form and the sortable, lazy-loading list.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
